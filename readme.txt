----Hello! Welcome to my workspace for my Space Application!----
----------------------------------------------------------------

  This is a work-in-progress application, as is evident by the 
  brevity of the repository so far, however I had an idea 
  (primarily to get some seat-time with python) to create an 
  application that utilizes the NASA open API's, to get information about 
  different objects and events in space. 
  
  The two features so far, are;
  1. 'Near Earth Object finder', based on
  user input in the form of YYYY, DD, MM. It returns a table of 
  events and objects from NASA's NEO table.
  
  2. An 'Earth-like Planet' finder feature, that asks for (so
  far) input from the user asking if they want to 
  find planets in our Planetary System that are
    -Bigger/Smaller?
    -More/Less Mass?
    -Longer/Shorter year?
   
  -More to come!-
